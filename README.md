How to run
==========

To run the project, you need to create an account on https://www.firebase.com/ and change the constant 
"YOUR_FIREBASE_URL" located in "app/config/mainConfig.js" to your firebase URL. 

By default, the authentication is disabled, but you can enable it and configure an authentication provider 
and login options for it.
